              <p>Today, I met a young girl from India who'd recently come to the UK.

                She'd worked in hotels before, but her resume had a gap ‚Äì she'd taken time off to care for her sick father. Her English was excellent, but there was sadness in her voice when she explained.

                She told me about putting her schooling on hold, running her family's business‚Ä¶the dreams she had to put aside.
                It reminded me how often women make those sacrifices, especially in some cultures.

                "But you made it here," I pointed out, "That takes strength."üí™

                Her smile told me she wasn't used to hearing that.
                I saw a spark in her.

                "Did you ever want to study further?" I asked.
                "What's the point of studying that way just for the sake of a certificate if it's not to study to learn something?"  She replied back with a smile.

                "If you could have done anything, if nothing stood in your way, what would you be?" I asked.

                "A doctor," she said quickly,  "It was always my dream... but,"  she paused,
                "I don't just dream about things beyond my reach."

                Though everyone has the luxury to dream more than what they can achieve in the present.
                That hit me hard!!
                I thought of all the chances I'd had, the doors that opened for me.

                We didn't have the perfect job for her yet. "But I know people..." I began, "There might be a way to get you an internship somewhere, to learn the system, and to get back into the work world"
                Her face lit up ‚Äì that hope was the same in any language.
                As she left, I couldn't help but think about the unseen struggles people face. Opportunity isn't equal for everyone.

                It's a luxury to DREAM, it's a luxury to choose a CAREER, it's a luxury to be LAZY.
                Today, that hit me harder than usual !!!!

                Tell me below: Do you think you're privileged? What does privilege mean to you?
